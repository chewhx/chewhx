### Greetings. ğŸ‘‹ 

By day I am a manager in the arts, despite a major in Acccountancy.
I steal time out of work and my life to be here because recently I'm serious about writing code.
My main interests are in responsive web, mobile app development, fin-tech applications.

- ğŸŒ± Currently learning more about React and SaSS.
- ğŸ”­ Shop around my repo and let me know if you see anything you like.
- ğŸ‘¯ Open to collaborate on projects.

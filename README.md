# Bonjour ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Han Xiang, Chew.

By day I am a manager in the arts, despite a major in Acccountancy.
I steal time out of work and my life to be here because recently I've gotten serious about writing code.
My main interests are in responsive web applications, mobile app development, fin-tech or data-driven applications, and project management.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on equipping myself to be a full-stack web developer.
- ðŸ”­ Look around my repo and let me know if you see anything you like.
- ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborate on projects or freelance opportunities.

**My learning notes and working files:**
- [learn-react-table](https://github.com/chewhx/learn-react-table)
- [devchallenges](https://github.com/chewhx/devchallenges)

**My recent creations:**
- [guess-the-flag](https://github.com/chewhx/guess-the-country-flags)
- [ui8-thegoodlifeblog](https://github.com/chewhx/ui8-thegoodlifeblog)
